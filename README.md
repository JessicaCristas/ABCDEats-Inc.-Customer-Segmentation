# ABCDEats-Inc.-Customer-Segmentation

Data analysis and customer segmentation project for ABCDEats Inc., using clustering techniques to identify customer groups and support data-driven marketing strategies based on spending patterns and behaviors.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a data analysis and customer segmentation challenge for **ABCDEats Inc. (ABCDE)**, a fictional food delivery service that partners with a variety of restaurants to provide diverse meal options. The goal was to analyze customer data collected over a three-month period from three different cities and help ABCDEats design a data-driven marketing strategy tailored to distinct customer segments.

The dataset included detailed transactional records, capturing information such as customer identities, food preferences, order frequencies, and spending patterns. Throughout the project, multiple data preprocessing steps were carried out to ensure data quality and integrity, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and eliminating duplicate entries.

## Methodology

Customer segmentation was approached from multiple perspectives:
- **Value-based segmentation:** grouping customers by their economic contribution.
- **Behavioral segmentation:** focusing on purchasing habits and food choices.
- **Demographic segmentation:** considering factors like age, gender, or income to understand different interaction patterns.

Clustering techniques, primarily **K-Means**, were applied to identify meaningful customer groups. Metrics such as the silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index were used to evaluate cluster quality.

## Outcomes

The final integrated segmentation helped uncover actionable insights, enabling ABCDEats to design targeted marketing strategies aimed at:
- Improving customer engagement
- Increasing customer retention
- Boosting overall profitability

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
